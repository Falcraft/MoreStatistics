# MoreStatistics
A minecraft plugin to add more statistics

Using the existing statistics page for minecraft : [Stats](https://falcraft.eu/stats/) some vanilla (and non-vanilla) statistics are missing.
This plugin is here to follow some new statistics

It is currently only working for 1.12.
This plugin creates a file for each player in the `MoreStatistics` folder, and adds the following statistics :
- `custom.tameEntity` : when taming an entity
- `stat.elytraPropels` : when using a firefork to propel oneself while gliding with the elytras
- `stat.recordPlayed` : when playing a record on the jukebox
- `stat.pathBlock` : when using the shovel to create a path block
- `stat.afkOneMinute` : used with essentialsX to determine the time a player has been AFK
- `stat.fellOfWorld` : whenever the player dies by falling into the void
- `stat.flyIntoWall` : whenever the player dies by colliding too fast while gliding
- `stat.burnInLava` : whenever the player dies because of lava
- `stat.killEntity.EnderDragon` : whenever the player kills the ender dragon
- `stat.killEntity.Wither` : whenever the player kills the wither boss
- `stat.killEntity.IronGolem` : whenever the player kills an iron golem
- `stat.shearSheep` : whenever the player uses the shears to shear a sheep
